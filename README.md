As an entrepreneur, one should understand that there is a phase where businesses struggle, even those that have been on a very high profit. Over the years, I have come to realize that the major driving force of a business is its customers experience.

*"If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful."* â€“ Jeff Bezos

## ABOUT PROJECT
This project is about an E-commerce company that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers sometimes order on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their effort on their Mobile App experience or their website. In this project, I created an algorithm using Python which makes prediction to help them solve that problem.

## IMPORTING THE NECESSARY PYTHON LIBRARIES
A library which is a collection of functions that we include in our python code and called as necessary. With libraries, pre-existing functions can be imported which will efficiently expand the code performance. For this project, I will import the following libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn e.t.c. Then set %matplotlib inline since I'm using a Jupiter notebook

## GETTING DATA
I worked with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company[Dataset]. It has Customer info, such as Email, Address, and their colour Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns: 
* Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
* Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes   
* Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
